            <img src="images/about-me-400.jpg" alt="Mary Alice Briggs headshot">

            <p>Welcome to my Costume Design Portfolio! I'm Mary Alice Briggs, an experienced costume
                designer based in Rexburg, Idaho. I bring a unique blend of <strong>creativity and vison</strong> to
                every
                project.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a young girl my exposure to theater began as my parents would take me to plays and musicals and
                we would watch recordings of musicals as a family.
                I grew to love the songs, the actors, the settings and the productions and they became part of my soul.
                As a college student I had the opportunity to do a study abroad in London.
                My experience included near <strong>daily experiences in the West End</strong> watching professional theater.
            </p>
            <p>    
                My journey came full circle as I became involved with my <strong>children's costumes</strong> throughout elementary
                school through high school.
                I once cut my son's thick red hair to create a matching beard for his "Brigham Young" character.
                My husband will tell you that I always have a strong opinon about the football uniforms worn each week
                as we watch our teams on TV.
                Those guys really need some costume help sometimes!
            </p>

            <p>
                What inspires me? Each production is unique, and the actors, directors, set and ambiance all play a role
                for me. Rather than just copying what has been done before,
                I want to infuse each production with <strong>creativity, vision and practicality</strong> which
                balances tasteful design with frugality.
            </p>

            <p>
                As I work with each actor, it's very important to me that they can <stong>"become" their character</stong> through the
                costume I create for them.
                I love that moment when the right costume is put on and the actor is transformed before our eyes. It's
                magic!
            </p>

            <p>
                Some of my notable <a href="costumes.html">costuming projects</a> include <strong>Into The Woods, Shrek,
                    Peter and the Star Catcher and Suite Surrender</strong>. These
                experiences have not only challenged me as a designer but have also allowed me to collaborate with
                talented individuals who share my passion for the arts.</p>

            <p>
                Outside of costume design, you might find me serving in the community.
                On various boards and committees I
                have planned and executed events large and small and have <strong>rallied a team of dedicated
                    volunteers</strong> around
                a common goal. This has served me well when working with costumes on various productions.
            </p>

            <p>
                I invite you now to explore my portfolio and get a glimpse into the world of costume design through my
                eyes. If you have any inquiries or would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out through my <a
