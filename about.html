            <h2>Mary Alice Briggs Design - About Me</h2>
            <img src="images/ma-city-rocks-headshot.jpg" alt="Mary Alice Briggs headshot">
            <p>Welcome to my Costume Design Portfolio! I'm Mary Alice Briggs, a passionate and dedicated costume
                designer based in Rexburg, Idaho. I bring a unique blend of <strong>creativity and technical
                    skill</strong> to every
                project.</p>

            <p>My journey in costume design began with love of <strong>classic broadway musicals and theater</strong>. As a young girl my
                parents would take me to plays and musicals and we would watch recordings of musicals as a family many
                Sundays. I grew to love the songs, the actors, the settings and the productions and they became part of
                my soul.</p>

            <p>What inspires me? Each production is unique, and the actors, directors, set and ambiance all play a role
                for me. Rather than just copying what has been done before,
                I want to infuse each production with <strong>creativity, vision and practicality</strong> which
                balances tasteful design
                with frugality.</p>

            <p>From concept to execution, my creative process is driven by a meticulous attention to detail and a
                commitment to bringing characters to life. I believe that costumes play a pivotal role in enhancing the
                visual narrative and creating a memorable audience experience.</p>

            <p>Some of my notable <a href="costumes.html">costuming projects</a> include <strong>Into The Woods, Shrek, Peter and the Star Catcher and Suite Surrender</strong>. These
                experiences have not only challenged me as a designer but have also allowed me to collaborate with talented individuals who
                share my passion for the arts.</p>

            <p>Outside of costume design, you might find me serving in the community. On various boards and committees I
                have planned and executed events large and small and have <strong>rallied a team of dedicated volunteers</strong> around
                a common goal. This has served be well when working with costumes on various productions.
            </p>

            <p>
                I invite you now to explore my portfolio and get a glimpse into the world of costume design through my
                eyes. If you have any inquiries or would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out through my <a
