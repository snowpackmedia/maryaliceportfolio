<h3>Into the Woods - Westlake High School</h3>
<p>
    This show was the classic Stephen Sondheim musical "Into the Woods" producted by the Westlake High School Drama department in Saratoga Springs, Utah.
    The cast size including leads and ensemble members was around 50 people, so a decent sized production. The lead roles were double cast which presented a unique challenge as the costumer,
    as the leads were not all the same size. Costumes that were similar had to be found that kept the vision of the show while still allowing for various body types.

<p>
    The overall vision for this show was to have each substory cast in their own color scheme. This was to visually help the audience put the story characters together. 
    In the pictures below you will see the baker's story cast in orange and yellow, the Cinderella story cast in silver tones, the Jack and the Beanstalk characters in browns and muted greens. 
    Additionally the story of the witch and Rupunzel are in black and purple and Red Riding Hood and her characters in the traditional red hues.
    This takes on additional meaning when the baker's wife meets the prince by chance in the wood. Her colors clash with his and at one point in their encouncter she proclaims "I'm in the wrong story!"
    These visual cues take the audience on a journey along with the actors as they each tell their story.
