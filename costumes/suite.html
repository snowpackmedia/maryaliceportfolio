<h3>Suite Surrender - Romance Theater Company</h3>
<p>
    Suite Surrender is a delightful comedy set in the 1940's and put on by the Romance Theater Company in Rexburg, Idaho.
    The play was put on by a cast of 9 adult community members.
    Although officially sponsored by the City of Rexburg, the company operates on very tight budgets which forced me to be creative.
    I found costume pieces at thrift stores and modified them as necessary for the players.
    I also gratefully received donations from a tuxedo shop that was going out of business that were used for the bellhop uniforms.
    I was also able to leverage many of my own personal connections to find missing costume articles to complete the play.

    My vision for the show was simple - to find an authentic 1940's style look for each of the players. 
    This required collaborating with the actors and giving specific feedback on costume pieces that they suggested.
