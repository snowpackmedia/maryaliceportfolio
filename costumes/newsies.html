<h3>Newsies - Rexburg City Youth Drama Camp</h3>
<p>
    The production of Newsies was put on by the City of Rexburg and their summer youth drama camp ensemble.
    This includes around 50 kids between the ages of 12 - 18 years old.
    Always cost consious, I worked with a limited budget and limited costume storage to pull from when building the costumes.

    For this show I wanted to maintain an authentic "Newsies" look with muted colors, caps, vests, cutoffs and long pants.
    Cast members helped were asked to find the pieces that I was looking for at thift stores, garage sales, or among their own wardrobes.
    With constructive feedback and encouragment I was able to maintain the look and feel I wanted while not spending over much on costumes.
    The youth were delighted as I worked with them to put their costumes together and they all felt confident in their roles.
