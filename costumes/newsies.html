<h3>Newsies - Rexburg City Youth Drama Camp</h3>
<p>
    Summer theater camp over 3 weeks.
    50 cast members between 12 years -18 years.
    Worked with limited budget and limited costume storage to pull from.
    Wanted to maintain authentic "Newsies" look with muted colors, caps, vests, cutoffs and long pants.
    Cast members helped find the pieces that I was looking for at thift stores, garage sales, etc.
