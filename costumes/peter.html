<h3>Peter and the Star Catcher - Westlake High School</h3>
<p>
    The production of Peter and the Star Catcher was producted by the Westlake High School Drama department in
    Saratoga Springs, Utah. This was a show with about 35 actors including leads and ensemble.
    Despite the smaller size of the cast this was a challenging show to costume because each ensemble actor was a
    sailor/pirate, a mermaid and an island native at some point in the show.

    My overall vision for Peter in the play was the gradual unveiling of the character Peter Pan.
    As the play progressed, Peter's costume changed ever so gradually until the final scene when he appeared fully as
    Peter Pan.
    This visually followed the arc of the play as Peter gradually transformed himself.

    The mermaid scene in the play allowed for some fun and outrageous costumes using lampshades as bikini tops for men and
    other colorfully decorated bikini tops for the women.

    In this production I used color to match characters. The sailors wore oranges and blues and the pirates wore dark sinister colors.

    I was also able to created my own island culture motif. Rather than the customary palm trees, I used maple leaves as
    the island symbol.
    Shields were cut in the shape of maple leaves. Maple leaf patterns were sewn into clothing, headdresses and
    everywhere throughout the island.
    This was a challenging yet fascinating show to costume.
