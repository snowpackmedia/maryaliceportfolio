<h3>Peter and the Star Catcher - Westlake High School</h3>
<p>
    Cast of 35
    Peter - he transformed one article of clothing at a time until he was Peter Pan at the very end.
    Mermaid scene - fun and outrageous using lampshades for bras for men, decorated bikini tops for women.
    Use of color to match characters - sailors (orange/blue), pirates (black/red)
    Created own island culture - fall colors. Maple leaves were the island symbol instead of palm trees.
    Giant maple leaves as shields. Worked closely with prop team. Sewn into clothing, headdresses, everywhere.
    Tricky because the ensemble all had three costumes with multiple pieces - mermaid, sailor/pirate, island native
