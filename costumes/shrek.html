<h3>Shrek the Musical - Westlake High School</h3>

<p>
    This show was the newer show "Shrek - The Musical" producted by the Westlake High School Drama department in
    Saratoga Springs, Utah.
    This was a show with about 50 actors including leads and ensemble.

    Shrek the Musical is an iconic show with a somewhat predictable look at feel based on the cartoon and the broadway
    show.
    Still, I felt like we could make this production our own by shaking things up a little bit.
    The lead character was a tall red-headed young man, and putting him in a green bald cap looked ridiculous.
    After consulting with the show director, we agreed that leaving his head as-is was a terrific effect.
    The rest of Shrek's outfit looks as one would expect with the vest and trousers.

    The Dulocians also have an iconic look, but I found a way to make them look like Dulocians without exactly following
    the color scheme found in other shows.
    The look of the conformist Dolocians is still maintained to great effect.

    The costume for each fairytale character was carefully chosen with input from the individual case members to help
    them achive the look that would help them best play their character.
    In the end each actor was able to let their freak flag fly!

    For the knights guarding the dragon keep I wanted to achieve a classic "medieval knight" look with armor, sword,
    shield and crest.

    The donkey was an interesting character who went through several costume iterations before we found the look that
    worked best for him. Sometimes patience pays off!

    Finally, the tap dancing rats were hand-crocheted by a family member to achieve a magnificent, yet hilarious look.
    The crocheted rats were an in-demand item after the production ended.
