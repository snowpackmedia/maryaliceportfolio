<h3>Shrek the Musical - Westlake High School</h3>

<p>
    Cast of about 50
    Iconic show, not trying to copy broadway or cartoon while still bringing the story to life.
    Shrek had red hair - no bald cap.
    Duloc - again didn't match colors from broadway or cartoon, still maintained the "stepford" look.
    Fairytale characters - worked with actors to help them achieve their individual vision for their character.
    Knights - medieval knight look
    Donkey - lots of iterations before the right look was acheived.
    Rats - hand crocheted by a family member to acheive just the right look.
